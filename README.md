# Chocolatey Package: FreeSWITCH

## Description

FreeSWITCH is designed to route and interconnect popular communication protocols using audio, video, text, or any other form of media. First released in January 2006, FreeSWITCH has grown to become the worldâ€™s premier open source soft-switch platform. This versatile platform is used to power voice, video, and chat communications on devices ranging from single calls on a Raspberry Pi to large server clusters handling millions of calls. FreeSWITCH powers a number of commercial products from start-ups to Carriers.

## Note

If the package fails, this might be due to the installation of kb2999226 (which is a dependency of this package) if your system is not up-to-date. This KB requires a reboot of the system before the freeswitch package installs successfully.

## Installation

```ps1
choco install freeswitch
```

## Disclaimer

These Chocolatey Packages only contain installation routines. The software itself is downloaded from the official sources of the software developer. I have no affilation with the software developer.
